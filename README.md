# TurtleDraw
This is a super simple example of how you could use the turtle package to make a simple drawing program. 
Honestly I only made this because I was working on making a simple collision detection algorithm using [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/2D_collision_detection) 
logic.

I will probably release the collision detection program soon, it's very simple and rudimentary.
